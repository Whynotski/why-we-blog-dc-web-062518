# Blogs

An introduction to blogging and why we do it

## Why blog?

* Show technical knowledge
* For you (the student); For your peers; For community; For employers
* Build community
* Build credibility
* Track progress
* Make contributions to others’ development, even as an early developer

## A Short and Happy Story about Blogging

Tracy Lum maintained a technical blog while she was a student and TA at Flatiron. When Tracy applied to be a developer at Rent the Runway, her future employers checked out her <a href="http://talum.github.io/">awesome blog</a> and were like, 'Wow--awesome blog! No need to give her a code challenge; Let's hire this way smart person!!'

## Other Good Stories

* A student from 062617 had their <a href="https://codeburst.io/bottom-of-the-barrel-8ef73eff00f0">blog post</a> picked up by a Medium publication.
* A student from 0217 had received a job offer from an employer who found him through his blog.

## What you need to do

* Write a blog once per module and present it on your scheduled day
* The topic of your post can be something we've covered in class or a technical topic not covered in class
* The blog post should be written on your own time outside of class.
* Use whichever platform you prefer: Medium, Wordpress, Jekyll
* The presentation will be less than 5 minutes with followup questions from your classmates

## YAY Topics
